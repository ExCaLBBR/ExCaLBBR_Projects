The suit claimed that the Department of Homeland Security had failed to conduct a mandatory review required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) before &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/border-wall\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;halting border wall construction&lt;/a&gt;, a key Trump-era project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under NEPA, a federal agency must conduct an Environmental Assessment to determine whether a federal action has the potential to cause significant effects on the human environment, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a two-day bench trial, Judge Trevor McFadden of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a ruling on Friday that Smith \"suffered concrete and particularized injuries\" as a result of DHS not meeting the requirements of NEPA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegal-immigrants-terrorism-ties-exploit-border-homeland-security-warns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITH ‘TERRORISM TIES’ WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLOIT BORDER, HOMELAND SECURITY REPORT WARNS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump-appointed judge also concluded that the actions taken by DHS, such as ending the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, resulted in indirect effects relating to population growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith testified that &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;migrant activity&lt;/a&gt; on his ranch had \"dramatically increased\" after President Joe Biden was elected, and that he had begun seeing illegal immigrants on his property multiple times a month and finds trash on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith claimed that the trash left by the migrants has had negative impacts on the environment, as well as on his own cattle, which were eating the litter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gaetz-introduce-bill-cutting-off-federal-aid-groups-helping-illegal-immigrants-enter-u-s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GAETZ TO INTRODUCE BILL CUTTING OFF FEDERAL AID TO GROUPS HELPING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ENTER US&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rancher also testified that water for cattle and other wildlife was a very scarce resource and that migrants were taking it from a trough on his land. According to court documents: \"While this may aid thirsty trespassers, it causes Smith to lose ‘thousands and thousands of gallons of water,’ which 'can take [him] days and days and days to regain.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge ruled that Smith, a Cochise County resident, \"suffered tangible harms\" caused by the migrant crisis and is entitled to relief after illegal immigrants \"trespassed onto his land, stole his water, and trashed his property.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"At trial, Smith proved as a matter of fact that his harms traced to migrants who reacted predictably to DHS's decisions,\" the ruling reads.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n",

The alleged altercation was purportedly sparked when the woman – identified only by the pseudonym \"Jane\" and described as a successful New York attorney – flirted with a valet, according to the article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Harris campaign, the Office of the Vice President and a representative for Emhoff's ex-wife, Kerstin Emhoff, did not comment despite repeated requests from Fox News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several media outlets, including Semafor, noted they had been unable to match the Daily Mail's reporting and legacy media companies such as the New York Times have yet to report on the claims. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Daily Mail's article hinged on the recollections of three people described as being Jane's friends. The outlet said its sources requested anonymity due to fear of retaliation from Emhoff. The three friends reportedly provided the outlet with a photo of the pair when they were still a couple, as well as itineraries and correspondence between Emhoff and Jane to substantiate that they made the trip to France in May 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/he-impregnated-his-kids-nanny-psaki-ripped-after-claiming-emhoff-reshaped-masculinity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'HE IMPREGNATED HIS KID'S NANNY': PSAKI RIPPED AFTER CLAIMING EMHOFF 'RESHAPED' MASCULINITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the sources is described by the Daily Mail as a female New York attorney who learned about the alleged incident from Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He hauled up and slapped her so hard she spun around,\" the source is quoted as saying. \"She said she was in utter shock. She was so furious, she slapped him on one side, and then on the other cheek with the other hand.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another friend, described by the Daily Mail as a New York businessman, told the outlet Jane called him sobbing following the alleged incident. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/progressive-womens-groups-silent-second-gentleman-doug-emhoffs-affair\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROGRESSIVE WOMEN'S GROUPS SILENT ON SECOND GENTLEMAN DOUG EMHOFF'S AFFAIR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It was very clear what she was telling me,\" that source said, according to the Daily Mail. \"She said she was with a guy, her date, she was at the Cannes Film Festival, and he hit her. She was in the car with the guy at the time.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The male friend said he learned more details about the alleged episode after the initial phone call. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It was something like 3 a.m. They were trying to get out of there and they both had been drinking. There was a gigantic line for taxis,\" he told the outlet. \"She went up to one of the valet guys, offered him 100 euros or whatever, to get to the head of the line. She told me she put her hand on his shoulder. Doug apparently thought that she was flirting, and came over and slapped her in the face.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third friend, described as a female executive, told the Daily Mail that she learned of the alleged incident in 2014, and purportedly found out new details from Jane in 2018, when Harris, then a senator from California, made headlines with her questioning of a Supreme Court nominee who had been accused of sexual assault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"[She] is a gorgeous, strong woman and you would never expect somebody to hit her,\" the third friend told the Daily Mail. \"When he hit her she hit him back, like, ‘Don’t you ever do that again,'\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/kamala-harris-husband-doug-emhoff-reshaped-perception-masculinity-msnbc-host\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;KAMALA HARRIS' HUSBAND DOUG EMHOFF 'RESHAPED THE PERCEPTION OF MASCULINITY': MSNBC HOST&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third Daily Mail source added: \"I asked her if he ever apologized. She said ‘no,’ but he commented about the hit she gave him. It was a tennis metaphor. But no apology at all.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three friends told the outlet that Jane hit Emhoff back after the alleged initial slap. They also claimed that Jane tried to leave the valet area after the alleged slap, but that Emhoff got into a cab with Jane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jane and Emhoff had been dating for about three months before the reported trip to France, according to the friends. Emhoff allegedly cut the trip short and returned to the U.S. for his daughter's birthday at the end of May, and never saw Jane again, the friends told the outlet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emhoff's alleged relationship with Jane unfolded after his 2008 divorce from his first wife and before his 2014 marriage to Harris. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Post on Wednesday slammed Emhoff as \"Worst Gentleman\" in its cover story detailing the Daily Mail's article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emhoff is fresh off of a Sunday sit-down interview on MSNBC during which Jen Psaki celebrated him as having reshaped \"the perception of masculinity.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"There is also an important, interesting part about how people have talked about your role is how your role has reshaped the perception of masculinity,\" Psaki said. \"I’m not sure you planned on that, but you are an incredibly supportive spouse. Has that been an evolution for you? Do you think that’s part of the role you might play as first gentleman?\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emhoff responded: \"It’s funny. I’ve started to think a lot about this. I’ve always been like this. My dad’s always been like this. To me, it’s the right thing to do, support women. It is mutual with Kamala and I. We support each other, we have each other’s back.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doug-emhoffs-ex-wife-responds-after-second-gentleman-admitted-affair-nanny\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;DOUG EMHOFF’S EX-WIFE RESPONDS AFTER SECOND GENTLEMAN ADMITTED TO AFFAIR WITH NANNY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: \"I’ve said many times when we lift up women, we support women, whether it’s pay equity, &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/parenting/family\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;child care, family leave&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and all of these issues in this post-Dobbs hellscape. Women should not be less than. Women should not have less rights and be treated differently. That’s not the American way.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clips of the exchange spread like &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;wildfire on social media as critics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; noted that, in August, Emhoff admitted to having an affair with his family’s nanny during his first marriage years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emhoff's admission came shortly after the Daily Mail published a separate report in August claiming that he got his daughter's nanny pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The affair occurred before Emhoff's relationship with and eventual marriage to Harris. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions. I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side,\" Emhoff said over the summer, acknowledging the affair, but not naming the nanny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emhoff and his first wife were married from 1992 to 2008 and share two adult children. Harris &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/parenting/family\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;married Emhoff in 2014&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and helped co-parent his children, who call their stepmom \"mommala.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/how-kamala-harris-husbands-cheating-scandal-could-help-trump-expert-says\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HOW KAMALA HARRIS' HUSBAND'S CHEATING SCANDAL COULD HELP TRUMP, EXPERT SAYS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emhoff reportedly told Jane in 2012 about his divorce, according to her female friend who works as an executive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Daily Mail's report was published just &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/elections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;five weeks before the election&lt;/a&gt;, when Harris will square off against former President Trump at the ballot box. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/elections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n",

              "<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Voters in Kent County, Michigan, could play a large role in determining who wins &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/elections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;November’s presidential election,&lt;/a&gt; but many voters in the area are still undecided about their choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I think there is too much division in his country. I think people on the left and people on the right hate each other a lot and I don’t think that’s right,\" said one Kent County voter, who told Fox News Digital he is still undecided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comments come as Kent County, which includes &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/michigan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Michigan’s second-largest city&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt; &lt;/a&gt;of Grand Rapids and much of the surrounding area, figures to play an outsized role in November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Michigan is well-known as one of the seven key swing states in the upcoming election, Kent County figures to be one of the key counties. Holding over 6% of the state’s population, the county has traditionally been known as a conservative haven. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trump-nfl-nba-kneeling-during-national-anthem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP TAKES NFL, NBA TO TASK ABOUT KNEELING DURING NATIONAL ANTHEM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, that trend has started to reverse itself in recent years, starting when former President Obama was able to capture the county in 2008. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, won the county during his presidential bid in 2012, while &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;former President Trump&lt;/a&gt; took Kent County in 2016. It went back to Democrats in 2020, when President Biden was able to capture this important part of Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s race promises to feature Kent County again, though some voters there remain unconvinced by the candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Something which stood out to me about Trump is that he didn’t bring us into any wars,\" one undecided voter said before noting that he believed Vice President Kamala Harris’ \"stance is a lot clearer on LGBTQ rights.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immigration stood out as an issue to some Kent County voters, with one telling Fox News Digital the issue was a matter of human rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"People having the rights to be in our country and the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/health-care\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;rights to health care&lt;/a&gt;,\" said the voter, who indicated he was voting for Harris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/tim-walz-jd-vance-vice-presidential-debate-october-1-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING ‘NEW’ FUTURE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Hopefully she can bring down housing costs and pretty much just inflation for young people like myself,\" he added. \"Trying to buy a house, trying to get loans and cars and things like that is very important for people of my age.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, another voter disagreed on &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/economy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;the economy&lt;/a&gt;, arguing Trump is the right candidate to lead the country forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I believe that a person who has run a company, that’s been in business, can do a better job than a lifelong politician in terms of making decisions,\" the voter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That voter also indicated support for Trump on foreign policy, arguing he garnered the respect of world leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I think he was not afraid to stand up for what he felt is right,\" he said. \"I think other world leaders took note of that.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another voter, who indicated foreign policy was a key issue, disagreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"One candidate gets it and the other doesn’t,\" the voter, who indicated support for Harris, told Fox News Digital of the reason he is voting for Harris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"She understands the importance of our standing on the global stage, international politics, and our national security. I don’t think Trump understands that,\" the voter continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet others had more trouble picking a candidate, most notably because of the divisive nature of modern politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"One day I’ll go one way and another day I’ll go another way,\" one undecided voter told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It’s hard to take her seriously, nothing sticks out about her,\" she said of Harris, while also noting that he finds it \"very hard to believe\" that someone as rich as Trump \"could care about people that don’t have any money.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The voter also deducted points from Trump because of the \"tone of his voice.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The name calling, I don’t particularly care for that,\" the voter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/elections\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n",

Adam Schiff&lt;/a&gt; issued a letter to major social media executives this week demanding they reveal how they will combat \"misinformation\" and \"disinformation\" in the 2024 election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter, co-signed by seven other members of Congress, accuses social media platforms such as &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;X, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok&lt;/a&gt; of failing to properly prepare for malicious info-hazards in November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We write to your platforms as concerned Members of Congress, seeking further information about your preparation for and response to the spread of misinformation and disinformation, or the potential incitement of violence on your platforms leading up to the 2024 elections,\" the California congressman wrote. \"We have already seen how posts with disinformation have spread on the major social media platforms both in the United States and across the globe during election cycles.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/nra-accuses-meta-election-interference-after-labeling-posts-hitting-harris-false-information\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NRA ACCUSES META OF 'ELECTION INTERFERENCE' AFTER LABELING POSTS HITTING HARRIS 'FALSE INFORMATION'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter continued, \"We continue to be concerned with each of your companies’ ability to react efficiently and effectively to misinformation and disinformation, or to any potential incitement of violence occurring on your platforms.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the letter, the signers accused social platforms Meta, Discord, and Snap specifically of \"[reducing] their elections team dramatically\" following the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/state-and-local/elections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;2022 elections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;X, Meta, and TikTok were singled out and scolded for having \"not increased their transparency for external groups who can aid in monitoring election information.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/newsoms-deepfake-election-laws-already-being-challenged-federal-court\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEWSOM'S DEEPFAKE ELECTION LAWS ARE ALREADY BEING CHALLENGED IN FEDERAL COURT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"While the impetus of this letter is the 2024 election, political and election-related mis- and disinformation persists even between elections, so we are also urging your companies to commit to taking action on election and political misinformation year-round, not just in the leadup to elections.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of specific questions are offered at the end of the letter, including \"Will your company be changing your election integrity policies between now and the 2024 U.S. general election?\" and \"How will your company be more transparent in enforcement of its community guidelines regarding election integrity and transparent with the public about actions it has taken?\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Will your company commit to sharing data and metrics on the effectiveness of your enforcement systems in relation to US elections and political speech?\" the Democratic congress members asked. \"How will your company address mis- and disinformation made by political actors or verified accounts, and how will they be treated differently, if at all, compared to ordinary users?\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/download\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter was co-signed by Democratic Representatives Julia Brownley of California, Andre Carson of Indiana, Dan Goldman of New York, Robert Garcia of California, Raúl M.

              "<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRST ON FOX&lt;/strong&gt;: More than 1.7 million migrants have been encountered at the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/border-security\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;U.S. border&lt;/a&gt; and have come from countries that officials believe pose a national security threat to the U.S., according to a new House report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report by the House Judiciary Committee says the number of \"special interest aliens\" (SIAs) came from a congressional staff briefing by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials. SIAs are those who have come from countries identified by the U.S. government as having conditions that promote or protect terrorism or potentially pose some sort of national security threat to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/homeland-security\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;DHS defined&lt;/a&gt; an SIA as \"a non-U.S. person who, based on an analysis of travel patterns, potentially poses a national security risk to the United States or its interests. Often such individuals or groups are employing travel patterns known or evaluated to possibly have a nexus to terrorism.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-visits-crucial-border-state-immigration-record-sparks-scrutiny-timeline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HARRIS VISITS CRUCIAL BORDER STATE AS IMMIGRATION RECORD SPARKS SCRUTINY: A TIMELINE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"DHS analysis includes an examination of travel patterns, points of origin, and/or travel segments that are tied to current assessments of national and international threat environments,\" it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The House report says that there are currently 26 special interest countries, including Afghanistan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, Syria and Turkey. The agency recently removed 11 countries from the list and added 12 others, including North Korea, China and Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. has seen numerous Chinese and Venezuelan nationals in particular, with nearly 300,000 Venezuelans encountered at the border this fiscal year so far and more than 73,000 Chinese nationals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Border Patrol sources have &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/thousands-special-interest-aliens-middle-east-countries-stopped-southern-border-2021-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;previously told Fox News&lt;/a&gt; they have extreme concerns about people coming across from special interest countries, given they have little to no way to vet them. Unless they have committed a crime in the U.S. or are on a federal watch list, agents have no way of knowing their criminal history because their countries do not share data with the U.S., so there is nothing to match their name against when authorities run their fingerprints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/illegal-immigrants-terrorism-ties-exploit-border-homeland-security-warns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITH ‘TERRORISM TIES’ WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLOIT BORDER, HOMELAND SECURITY REPORT WARNS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee said that DHS told the committee that being a national from a special interest country does not affect a migrant’s admissibility into the U.S., although officials have previously stressed that all migrants are vetted using a multi-layered process that includes biographic and biometric information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example of the risks that can be posed by the release of SIA migrants, the committee pointed to the case of &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-scrambles-close-loophole-allowed-migrant-terror-watchlist-go-free\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Mohammad Kharwin&lt;/a&gt;, who was released into the U.S. and later on bond by an immigration judge despite potential terror ties. The DHS located and rearrested him two weeks later. DHS has since agreed to a voluntary departure of Kharwin from the U.S., and he is currently in ICE custody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Congress must take seriously its efforts to secure the border and stop the weakening of U.S. national security,\" the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"As the case of Mohammad Kharwin exemplifies, the Biden-Harris Administration has sown chaos at America’s borders and allowed potential national security and counterintelligence threats to enter the United States — and, at least in Kharwin’s case, be released into the country multiple times,\" it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report found that there were around 98,000 SIA encounters in FY 21, which went up to 482,705 in FY 22, then 597,058 in FY 23 and 531,768 in FY 24 so far. Of those, most were encountered at the southern border, with 95,705 southwest border encounters of special interest aliens in fiscal year 2021; 465,664 in 2022; 566,079 in 2023; and 504,215 in 2024 so far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in SIAs has come amid an ongoing debate about the southern border and how to tackle it. The Biden administration has pointed to a sharp drop in encounters since June, which it attributes to a June presidential proclamation which limited the number of asylum entries into the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to those numbers, encounters between ports of entry have decreased by more than 50%, and DHS has removed or returned more than 131,000 individuals to more than 140 countries, including operating more than 400 international repatriation flights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"In that period, DHS has almost tripled the percentage of noncitizens processed for Expedited Removal, and the percentage of releases pending immigration court proceedings is down nearly half. Total removals and returns over the past year exceed removals and returns in any fiscal year since 2010 and a majority of all southwest border encounters during the past three fiscal years resulted in a removal, return, or expulsion,\" Customs and Border Protection said in a release last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also called for the passage of a bipartisan Senate bill that would increase funding to border agencies, including for detention beds, and would also place limits on migrant entries into the U.S. Conservatives have said it would codify high levels of illegal immigration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Vice President Kamala Harris&lt;/a&gt; visited the border in Arizona last week and hammered former President Trump for his lack of support for the bipartisan bill. However, Republicans have noted that the House passed a sweeping border security bill last year, but the Senate has yet to pass that either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News' Bill Melugin contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/elections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n",

Sherrod Brown on his Inflation Reduction Act vote in a new ad that's part of a $25 million new buy ahead of Election Day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/dJ9dfI2bh40\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"&gt;30-second ad spot&lt;/a&gt;, which will run on television and digitally, opens with a single mother from Versailles, Ohio, saying she can’t believe the current prices for groceries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It’s a lot tougher to provide for my kids with the Democrats’ inflation,\" the woman, Carla, says. \"Sherrod Brown’s only made things worse. Brown supported Kamala, not us, and voted for her radical Inflation Act, and now prices are at a 40-year-high. Bernie Moreno will fight to lower prices and stop inflation. That’s why I trust Bernie Moreno to help Ohio families.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ad, first obtained by Fox News Digital in advance of its planned roll out, also includes the message on screen: \"Sherrod Brown voted for Kamala’s Inflation Act.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/virginia-senate-debate-clinton-ex-running-mate-kaine-gop-challenger-cao-spar-immigration-dei-military\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIRGINIA SENATE DEBATE: CLINTON EX-RUNNING MATE KAINE, GOP CHALLENGER CAO SPAR ON IMMIGRATION, DEI IN MILITARY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was paid for by Bernie Moreno for Senate and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Hardworking Ohioans are suffering under the record-high inflation created by Kamala Harris and Sherrod Brown,\" Moreno said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"While he claims to fight for Ohio, families are unable to afford basic necessities. In November, we will send him packing and get our economy back on track.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreno’s campaign told Fox News Digital that the ad is part of an additional $25 million in spending. It comes just 33 days before the Nov. 5 election. Early voting in Ohio starts Oct. 8. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contest is on track to be the most expensive Senate race this cycle, with $310.4 million in spending from both campaigns as of August, according to Axios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of August, Moreno shelled out $158.4 million and Brown spent $152 million, Axios reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown's campaign announced Wednesday it will report raising nearly $31 million in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News has labeled the race between Moreno and Brown as a toss-up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nra-targets-sen-sherrod-brown-seven-figure-ad-buy-ohio-refuse-protect-our-rights-self-defense\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NRA TARGETS SEN SHERROD BROWN IN 7-FIGURE AD BUY IN OHIO: 'VOTE LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to Brown's campaign and congressional office for comment about the new ad but did not immediately hear back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ohio is center stage on the presidential ticket this cycle with &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/why-vance-easily-beat-walz-debate-softening-his-image-process\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Sen. JD Vance&lt;/a&gt;, R-Ohio, as former President Trump's vice presidential running mate. Moreno ran against Vance in the 2022 GOP Republican primary for Senate, which Vance won, and has supported the Trump-Vance bid for the White House. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 2023, on the one-year anniversary of President Biden signing his Inflation Reduction Act into law, Brown's campaign issued a statement championing the legislation as having included \"key priorities Brown fought for to save Ohioans money, crack down on Wall Street stock buybacks, and attract investment and good-paying jobs to Ohio.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The Inflation Reduction Act is already saving Ohioans money at the pharmacy counter and spurring Ohio to lead the country in manufacturing the technology of the future – and those cost savings and Ohio jobs will only grow in the coming years,\" Brown said in a statement at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of August 2024, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) in the Midwest – which includes Ohio – rose by 2.6% over the last 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bureau said the index for all items, less food and energy, advanced 3.2% over the year, while food prices increased 1.8%. Energy prices declined 2.6%, \"largely the result of decreasing prices for gasoline,\" it added. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n",

              "<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;President Biden&lt;/a&gt; spends a second straight day surveying damage and getting briefed on recovery and relief efforts in the storm-damaged Southeast, he's once again coming under political attack from former President Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the death toll from Hurricane Helene climbs to close to 200 people, with hundreds still missing, millions still without power or running water, and damage estimated in the billions, &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Trump took to social media&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday morning to paint Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as incompetent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Kamala and Sleepy Joe are universally being given POOR GRADES for the way that they are handling the Hurricane, especially in North Carolina,\" Trump charged in a social media post. \"It is going down as the WORST &amp;amp; MOST INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED ‘STORM,’ AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, EVER SEEN BEFORE.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, who's locked in a margin-of-error race with Harris with less than five weeks to go until Election Day in November, has been attacking the vice president and her boss over the federal response to the powerful storm for nearly a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-harris-head-hurricane-ravaged-southeast-wake-trump-visit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN, HARRIS INSPECT DAMAGE IN HURRICANE-RAVAGED SOUTHEAST IN WAKE OF TRUMP VISIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with two of the hardest-hit states — North Carolina and Georgia — among the seven key battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/elections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;the 2024 presidential election,&lt;/a&gt; the hurricane has become front-and-center in the White House race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump this past weekend accused Biden of \"sleeping\" at his beach house in Delaware as the storm blasted the Southeast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-residents-fight-survival-basic-goods-become-scarce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NORTH CAROLINA RESIDENTS FIGHT FOR THEIR SURVIVAL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking with reporters as he arrived in &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/georgia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Valdosta, Georgia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, on Monday to survey storm damage and bring relief aid, the former president charged that \"the federal government is not being responsive.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Trump falsely claimed that Biden had not spoken with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a conservative Republican.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pushing back against the political attacks, Biden has noted that he was on the phone with federal, state and local officials throughout the weekend and returned to the nation's capital on Sunday afternoon to monitor storm rescue and relief efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We had over 1,000 federal personnel, including search and rescue teams, at the ready on the ground before it hit,\" the president said on Tuesday. \"Over the past several days, I've been in regular contact with the governors, the mayors, the county officials, and all the affected areas. That includes Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and Virginia.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden emphasized that his administration has sent \"every available resource that we have at our disposal to the affected region\" and pledged \"we'll be there until this work is done.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/weather\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON HELENE'S HAVOC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half of the deaths from the storm are in &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/north-carolina\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;North Carolina,&lt;/a&gt; where entire communities in the western part of the state were demolished by fast-moving waters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the floodwaters from the storm receded, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper lamented that, in the western part of his state, \"communities were wiped off the map.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president on Wednesday was in North Carolina, where he surveyed damage from a helicopter flight over the city of Ashville, one of the hardest hit areas. Biden also visited a rescue command center in the state before also stopping in neighboring South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"My top priority is to ensure the communities devastated by this hurricane get the help and support they need as quickly as possible,\" Biden told reporters Tuesday as he spoke during a Cabinet meeting focusing on the federal response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of his trip to the region, the president green-lighted the use of up to 1,000 active duty troops to support relief efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huddled with Democratic and Republican politicians from the region on Wednesday, Biden emphasized that \"in a moment like this, we put politics aside, at least we should put it all aside. We have here — there are no Democrats or Republicans, only Americans — our job is to help as many people as we can, as quickly as we can, and as thoroughly as we can.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump on Sunday attacked Harris for attending \"fundraising events with her radical left lunatic donors\" in California over the weekend. And he argued that Harris \"ought to be down in the area\" where the storm caused destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday during his stop in Georgia, Trump repeated the dig, saying, \"The vice president, she's out someplace campaigning looking for money.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House has highlighted that the vice president over the weekend was on the phone with federal, state and local officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris said on Saturday that she and the president \"remain committed to ensuring that no community or state has to respond to this disaster alone.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Harris&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; visited Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington, D.C., where she received a briefing on relief and rescue efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We will do everything in our power to help communities respond and recover,\" she vowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris on Wednesday traveled to Georgia to survey the impacts of the storm and receive an on-the-ground briefing and provide updates on the federal response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We are here for the long haul,\" Harris told residents in Augusta. \"There’s a lot of work that’s going to need to happen over the coming days, weeks, and months, and the coordination that we have dedicated ourselves to will be long-lasting to get families, to get residents, to get neighborhoods back up and running.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris was originally scheduled to take part Wednesday in a campaign bus swing through central Pennsylvania, another key battleground state, with her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the vice president headed to Georgia, Walz headlined the bus tour, which came the day after he faced off in the vice presidential debate against Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his Monday stop in Georgia, Trump highlighted, \"I've come to Valdosta with large semi-trucks, many of them filled with relief aid. A tanker truck filled up with gasoline, a couple of big tanker trucks filled up with gasoline, which they can't get now. And we'll be working to distribute it throughout the day.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a GoFundMe page set up by the Trump campaign earlier this week has raised over $4 million so far for storm victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I'm committed to traveling to the impacted areas as soon as possible, but I've been told that it would be disruptive if I did it right now. We will not do that at the risk of diverting or delaying any of the response assets needed to deal with this crisis,\" Biden told reporters on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Harris said on Tuesday, \"I plan to be on the ground as soon as possible — but as soon as possible without disrupting any emergency response operations, because that must be the highest priority and the first order of business.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the optics of Trump's Monday stop in Georgia may have put some political pressure on Biden and Harris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longtime Republican strategist David Kochel said Trump had been \"very aggressive\" with his quick trip to the storm-damaged region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I think he put a lot of pressure on them to try to do something,\" Kochel, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns, told Fox News. \"He’s out there pushing a line that they don’t care, they’re not doing anything, and I think they’re reacting to it.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The response by elected officials to natural disasters can impact their political standing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President George W. Bush was heavily criticized in the summer of 2005 for his initial response to Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Trump faced criticism early in his White House tenure as Puerto Rico struggled to recover from a powerful storm. The president was pilloried for throwing paper towels to the crowd as he stopped by a relief center during a storm-related visit to the island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/elections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n",

              "<description>The Biden administration is failing to protect federal resources from damage or destruction during violent protests, according to conservative watchdog group Protect the Public&amp;apos;s Trust.</description>\n",
              "<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;The Biden administration&lt;/a&gt; is \"failing\" to protect federal property from wanton destruction at the hands of left-wing protesters, says a conservative government watchdog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter sent to the inspector general for the Department of the Interior (DOI) on Thursday morning, Michael Chamberlain of the nonprofit group Protect the Public's Trust outlined several instances of protests that ended in some sort of disturbance to land or cultural symbols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2021, &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-protests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;protest groups&lt;/a&gt; occupied the DOI headquarters. In June 2024, anti-Israel protesters vandalized federal properties in Washington, D.C., and clashed with police. In July 2024, similar protesters vandalized Columbus Plaza, burned federal property, and assaulted police and bystanders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/hurricane-helene-wreaks-havoc-across-asheville-nc-national-guard-deployed-119-rescued\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HURRICANE HELENE WREAKS HAVOC ACROSS ASHEVILLE, NC; NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYED, 119 RESCUED&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Is the continued failure of Secretary Haaland’s Department to enforce the law or even the provisions of the permits it provides mere negligence? Or could it be an outgrowth of sympathy among DOI political leadership with the agendas of violent protestors?\" Chamberlain asked Fox News Digital.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"When you look at the behavior of some Department leaders -- including multiple determinations by the Inspector General of ethics violations -- neither possibility can be dismissed out of hand,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-strikes-within-lebanon-after-hezbollah-ballistic-missile-forces-millions-tel-aviv-bomb-shelters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ISRAEL STRIKES WITHIN LEBANON AFTER HEZBOLLAH BALLISTIC MISSILE FORCES MILLIONS IN TEL AVIV INTO BOMB SHELTERS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each instance, especially during the June and &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/college-students-express-concerns-expect-anti-israel-protests-return-campus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;July 2024 protests, &lt;/a&gt;Chamberlain's letter charges that the National Park Service (NPS) failed to enforce the law and maintain order, allowing key symbols of national history and culture to be defaced and destroyed, \"symbols that it is a part of NPS’s core mission to steward and protect.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"These failures appear to be enabled by a reckless failure to properly enforce demonstration permit conditions and provide the United States Park Police (\"USPP\") with the resources they need to effectively do their jobs,\" the letter states. \"We call upon you to immediately investigate these failures, including determining whether political considerations played an improper role in leaving cultural resources vulnerable to damage and destruction.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DOI has also drawn the ire of some Republican lawmakers over their handling of protests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The Union Station rioters over the summer chanted terrorist slogans, hurled what appeared to be human feces at U.S. Park Police officers, destroyed government property, burned American flags and an effigy of Prime Minister Netanyahu, and raised a Palestinian flag in its place,\" Rep. Bruce Westerman, chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"D.C. is no stranger to protests and free speech demonstrations, but clearly in this case something went horribly off the rails,\" the Arkansas Republican said. \"The organizers of this event knowingly violated nearly every one of the terms and conditions of their permit, and DOI and NPS also failed to provide critical support for the Park Police. This despite the history of the ANSWER Coalition and knowing well in advance that protests were expected. Oversight is imperative to ensure a security failure of this magnitude does not happen again.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top Republican on&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/senate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt; the Senate&lt;/a&gt; Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo, also demanded answers from the DOI Secretary Deb Haalan in June over its handling of violent protests that engulfed National Park Service property outside the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-5-clashes-between-vance-walz-during-debate-showdown-your-mics-cut\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP 5 CLASHES BETWEEN VANCE AND WALZ DURING DEBATE SHOWDOWN: 'YOUR MICS ARE CUT'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barrasso demanded that Haaland account for the lack of arrests by describing how she is working with law enforcement to identify suspects. He also called on the department to implement explicit measures to protect federal park rangers on-duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No arrests were made following the chaos, but NBC News reported one individual who had scaled a statue slipped away from a law enforcement officer who was attempting to detain them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statuary honoring two key French figures in the American Revolution – the Comte de Rochambeau and Marquis de Lafayette – were vandalized during the protests. Ironically, President Biden happened to be in France at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The watchdog group also criticized the DOI earlier this year for allocating $120 million to tribal governments to combat the impacts of &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-interior-department-allocate-120-million-address-climate-related-threats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;climate change. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DOI declined to comment to Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital's Charles Creitz contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n",

              "<description>Special counsel Jack Smith argues in a new court filing that former President Donald Trump is not immune from prosecution for his conduct immediately after the 2020 presidential election.</description>\n",
              "<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/federal-courts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;federal judge&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday unsealed a key filing from special counsel Jack Smith's updated election interference case against former President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-trial-stemming-from-jack-smiths-probe-delayed-past-election-day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Tanya Chutkan&lt;/a&gt; unsealed Smith's 165-page filing, in which Smith argues that Trump is not immune from prosecution for his alleged criminal scheme to overturn the 2020 election results. Smith submitted the document after the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that a president is immune from prosecution for official acts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Although the defendant was the incumbent President during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one,\" Smith wrote. \"Working with a team of private co-conspirators, the defendant acted as a candidate when he pursued multiple criminal means to disrupt, through fraud and deceit, the government function by which votes are collected and counted — a function in which the defendant, as President, had no official role.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court's decision in Trump v. United States held that Smith could not prosecute Trump for the president's alleged use of the Justice Department to look into unproven claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. In response, Smith filed an updated indictment that revised the allegations against Trump to fit within the scope of the Supreme Court's decision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-unseals-key-filing-special-counsels-election-case-against-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUDGE UNSEALS KEY FILING IN SPECIAL COUNSEL'S ELECTION CASE AGAINST TRUMP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the unsealed filing, Smith told the court that Trump is not immune from the remaining allegations against him and laid out his case for why Trump \"must stand trial for his private crimes.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Trump has pleaded not guilty&lt;/a&gt; to all charges brought against him by Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are five key details from the special counsel's new filing, which is partially redacted: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the filing unsealed Wednesday, Smith outlined a \"factual proffer,\" alleging Trump \"resorted to crimes to try to stay in office\" after losing the 2020 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"With private co-conspirators, the defendant launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn the legitimate election results in seven states that he had lost—Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,\" Smith wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"His efforts included lying to state officials in order to induce them to ignore true vote counts; manufacturing fraudulent electoral votes in the targeted states; attempting to enlist Vice President Michael R. Pence, in his role as President of the Senate, to obstruct Congress’s certification of the election by using the defendant’s fraudulent electoral votes; and when all else had failed, on January 6, 2021, directing an angry crowd of supporters to the United States Capitol to obstruct the congressional certification.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/prosecutors-request-indefinite-delay-trial-trump-assassination-attempt-suspect-ryan-routh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROSECUTORS REQUEST INDEFINITE DELAY IN TRIAL FOR TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SUSPECT RYAN ROUTH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith claims that the \"throughline of these efforts was deceit,\" alleging &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Trump and co-conspirators&lt;/a&gt; engaged in a conspiracy to interfere with the federal government function by which the nation collects and counts election results, which is set forth in the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act (ECA); a conspiracy to obstruct the official proceeding in which Congress certifies the legitimate results of the presidential election; and a conspiracy against the rights of millions of Americans to vote and have their votes counted.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith claims that several people close to Trump had told the former president his claims of election fraud were \"bulls---.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Smith, in one conversation, an unnamed Trump attorney had told Trump that the campaign was \"looking into his fraud claims and had even hired external experts to do so, but could find no support for them.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He told the defendant that if the Campaign took these claims to court, they would get slaughtered because the claims are all ‘bulls---,’\" the filing states, with Smith claiming that a lawyer discussed with Trump the investigations and \"debunkings on all major claims.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the attorney allegedly told Trump that &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-judge-dismisses-two-criminal-counts-against-trump-fani-willis-2020-election-interference-case\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Georgia's audit&lt;/a&gt; disproved claims that votes had been altered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blasts-doj-election-interference-calls-federal-case-scam-after-judge-unseals-smiths-key-filing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP BLASTS DOJ FOR ‘ELECTION INTERFERENCE,’ CALLS JACK SMITH CASE A ‘SCAM’ AFTER JUDGE UNSEALS KEY FILING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith also claims a senior campaign adviser who spoke with Trump on a \"daily basis\" and had \"informed him on multiple occasions that various fraud claims were false\" had complained that Trump was losing his election lawsuits because his lawyers could not back up false claims about the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"When our research and campaign legal team can't back up any of the claims made by our Elite Strike Force Legal Team, you can see why we're 0-32 on our cases,\" the campaign adviser allegedly wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I'll obviously hustle to help on all fronts, but it's tough to own any of this when it's all just conspiracy s--- beamed down from the mothership.\"  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The filing details several alleged interactions between Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence in the days following the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith details a Nov. 7, 2020, call between Pence and Trump in which Pence allegedly \"tried to encourage\" Trump \"as a friend\" by reminding him that he \"took a dying political party and gave it a new lease on life.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith also details a private lunch between Trump and Pence on Nov. 12, 2020, when Pence allegedly gave Trump a \"face-saving option.\" That option, according to the filing, was \"don’t concede but recognize the process is over.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another private lunch between &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mike-pence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Trump and Pence&lt;/a&gt; on Nov. 16, 2020, Pence allegedly tried to encourage Trump to accept the results of the election and run again in 2024. Trump is alleged to have responded, \"I don’t know, 2024 is so far off.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-trial-stemming-from-jack-smiths-probe-delayed-past-election-day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP TRIAL STEMMING FROM JACK SMITH'S PROBE DELAYED PAST ELECTION DAY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In yet another private lunch on Dec. 21, Pence allegedly \"encouraged\" Trump \"not to look at the election ‘as a loss – just an intermission.'\" Later that day in the Oval Office, Trump allegedly asked Pence for advice on what he should do. According to Smith, Pence said, \"after we have exhausted every legal process in the courts and Congress, if we still came up short, Trump should ‘take a bow.’\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Smith reveals that Trump allegedly showed little regard for Pence's safety during the Jan. 6, 2023 riot at the U.S. Capitol after it became clear that Pence would not support his attempt to stop the certification of the election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith alleges that an unnamed Trump aide, \"upon receiving a phone call alerting him that Pence had been taken to a secure location… rushed to the dining room to inform the defendant [Trump] in hopes that the defendant would take action to ensure Pence’s safety.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith writes that instead, after the aide delivered the news, Trump \"looked at him and said only, ‘So what?'\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith alleges that Trump at multiple times showed complete disregard for those who informed him his claims of voter fraud were false, including Republican elections officials in states where Trump had claimed the election was stolen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Election officials, for instance, issued press releases and other public statements to combat the disinformation that the defendant and his allies were spreading,\" Smith wrote. \"At one point long after the defendant had begun spreading false fraud claims, [REDACTED], a White House staffer traveling with the defendant, overheard him tell family members that ‘it doesn’t matter if you won or lost the election. You still have to fight like hell.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith goes on to assert that Trump and his legal team \"repeatedly changed the numbers in their baseless fraud allegations from day to day,\" and even \"made up figures from whole cloth.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-indicted-second-time-election-subversion-case-brought-special-counsel-jack-smith\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP INDICTED A SECOND TIME IN ELECTION SUBVERSION CASE BROUGHT BY SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The special counsel claimed Trump \"was on notice that there was no evidence of widespread election fraud in Arizona within a week of the election\" and claimed Trump also \"had early notice that his claims of election fraud in Georgia were false.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time Trump spoke at his &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/capitol-protests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;rally on Jan. 6&lt;/a&gt;, after Pence had refused to stop the certification of the election, Smith said the former president knew his \"last hope\" to overturn the results was \"the large and angry crowd standing in front of him.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"So for more than an hour, the defendant delivered a speech designed to inflame his supports and motivate them to march to the Capitol. The defendant told the crowd many of the same lies he had been telling for months—privately and publicly, including to the officials in the targeted states—and that he knew were not true.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith argues that based on a \"factbound analysis\" of Trump's conduct, the court should determine that the former president was not acting in his official capacity when he challenged the election results and is therefore not immune from prosecution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"None of the allegations or evidence is protected by presidential immunity,\" Smith wrote, asserting Trump's \"scheme was a private one.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He extensively used private actors and his campaign infrastructure to attempt to overturn the election results and operated in a private capacity as a candidate for office,\" Smith claimed. \"To the limited extent that the superseding indictment and proffered evidence reflect official conduct, however, the Government can rebut the presumption of immunity because relying on that conduct in this prosecution will not pose a danger of intrusion on the authority or functions of the Executive Branch.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital's Brooke Singman and Fox News' Jake Gibson contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n",

              "<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Republican challenger Hung Cao clashed on the debate stage Wednesday night on a range of issues including immigration, education and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in the military. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaine, who previously served as governor of Virginia and was Hillary Clinton's vice presidential running mate in 2016, made his case during the hourlong showdown at Norfolk State University on why he should keep his seat in the upper chamber of Congress. The only debate of the campaign focused on national issues and matters that resonate in Virginia and the coastal city of Norfolk, which is home to the country’s largest Navy base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cao, a 25-year Navy veteran &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hung-cao-wins-virginias-republican-senate-primary-take-tim-kaine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;endorsed by former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;, criticized COVID vaccine mandates for service members and the Biden-Harris administration's botched Afghanistan withdrawal when asked about the military’s collective failure to recently meet recruiting goals. He also criticized DEI efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"When you’re using a drag queen to recruit for the Navy, that’s not the people we want,\" Cao said. \"What we need is alpha males and alpha females who are going to rip out their own guts, eat them and ask for seconds. Those are the young men and women that are going to win wars.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/virginia-school-board-pay-wrongfully-fired-teacher-who-refused-use-students-preferred-pronouns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIRGINIA SCHOOL BOARD TO PAY 'WRONGFULLY FIRED' TEACHER WHO REFUSED TO USE STUDENT'S PREFERRED PRONOUNS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaine, who is on the Senate &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/armed-services-republicans-push-back-accusation-zelenskyys-pa-visit-political\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Armed Services Committee&lt;/a&gt;, responded by saying that railing at DEI \"is a red herring\" and the real challenge is informing more Americans about the benefits of the military when only about 1% of the population serves in the armed forces. \"We need to do a better job of talking about the G.I. Bill and other benefits as well as the tremendous leadership training that you get in the military,\" Kaine said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cao, meanwhile, brought up the G.I. Bill when challenging Kaine on student loan forgiveness. The incumbent Democrat had praised the Biden administration for having forgiven \"the loans of more than a million public servants in thanks for the public service they provide, whether it's in the military, whether it's teaching, whether it's working as a frontline health professional or working for a local or state government.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moderator then posed a question to Cao on how the Republican candidate would ease the burden, noting that the U.S. Department of Education reports more than a million Virginians owe a collective $43 billion in federal student debt as of last October, impacting their ability to contribute to the state's economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"If you're struggling to pay for your school, then get a G.I. Bill,\" Cao said. \"That means go out and serve in the military. You'll get a stipend as well as tuition. We need to fix education, and we need to do it now. But here's the thing with people like Senator Kaine, you've been an officer for 30 years in various offices, in the U.S. Senate for 12. Why have you not fixed it yet?\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/virginia-faa-contractor-allegedly-spied-iran-shared-private-info-us-airports-energy-industry-doj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIRGINIA FAA CONTRACTOR ALLEGEDLY SPIED FOR IRAN, SHARED PRIVATE INFO ON US AIRPORTS, ENERGY INDUSTRY: DOJ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaine responded by saying Virginia \"was named the best state for a child to be raised in the United States\" and \"the best managed state and the best state to do business\" when he was governor from 2006 to 2010. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Oh, again, he says what he's going to do,\" Cao shot back. \"Honestly, of the 227 bills that Senator Kaine has proposed, only three of them made it through… That's a 99% failure rate.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Check the tape on that. That's completely wrong,\" Kaine insisted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Cao retorted, \"There's two truths in the world, okay? Never walk into a target store wearing a red shirt and never go against an Asian when it comes to math. Trust me.\" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\"He's got a 99% failure rate,\" Cao added. \"If I just had 99% failure rate, and I defused bombs, I wouldn't be here right now.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moderator also pressed Cao, whose family fled Vietnam during the 1970s, on whether he supports the mass deportation of \"all undocumented immigrants.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"When Vietnam fell, we had nowhere to go, and America had brought us in and my parents waited in line for seven years. We all did for seven years to get our citizenship. The last thing that my dad had [hung] over his bed when he passed away two years ago was his naturalization certificate. I love this country so much that I wrote a blank check – up to including my life – to defend it for 25 years in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia and other parts of the world,\" Cao said. \"Here's my thing to anybody who wants to come here, don't ask for an American dream. If you're not willing to be American laws and embrace the American culture, because I did.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"If you come here illegally, then you need to leave, especially if you're a violent crime person,\" Cao said, citing &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tens-thousands-illegal-immigrants-sexual-assault-homicide-convictions-roaming-us-streets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;new Immigration and Customs Enforcement data&lt;/a&gt; provided to lawmakers last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"There are 13,000 convicted murderers and 16,000 convicted rapists that came across under their watch. That's unacceptable. We need to protect Americans every single day,\" Cao said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"If you came here illegally, you’ve basically screwed up the whole system,\" Cao said. \"You can’t jump the line – I mean, you go to Costco and jump the line, what do you think is going to happen? You can’t come here and expect the American dream if you’re not willing to obey the American laws and embrace the American culture.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Deport anybody that's committing crimes right now,\" he added. \"That's the first thing we need. Secure the border.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaine said he never supported mass amnesty but believes it would \"devastate the economy\" to deport the 10 million illegal immigrants who crossed the border during the Biden-Harris administration – a figure the moderator cited and the Democratic candidate echoed. He also slammed former President Donald Trump for asking Republicans to oppose the last congressional border deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We recently negotiated a very tough border deal that would have put a lot of resources on the border to stop illegal immigration,\" Kaine said. \"President Trump asked for Republicans to oppose it, even though it was supported by the border control union.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another subject was Trump’s proposal to place more tariffs on imported goods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"What we need to do is not tax our industry here,\" Cao said. \"What we need to do is tax other countries bringing in goods.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaine criticized &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/economists-weigh-pros-cons-trump-plan-60-tariff-china\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Trump’s proposal&lt;/a&gt;. \"The Trump tariffs would be a massive tax that would cause prices on all of these items that are imported to go up,\" Kaine said. \"On that, I differ strongly from my opponent.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Kaine’s seat considered solidly Democratic, the race has not seen the kind of dead-heat polling as the national presidential contest or the high-stakes drama of other Senate races such as those in Montana and Ohio, where Democratic incumbents face tough re-election bids, according to The Associated Press. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump has endorsed Cao, and political scientists say his path to victory is narrow given Virginia’s moderate electorate, aversion to Trump in 2020 and Kaine’s salience with voters, according to the AP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaine won his last race in 2018 by 16 percentage points, although he said he was preparing for a tough race this year. The most recent Republican from Virginia to hold a U.S. Senate seat was the late John Warner, a centrist with an independent streak who last won in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republicans have won statewide offices in Virginia. Glenn Youngkin was elected governor by two points in 2021, along with a Republican lieutenant governor and attorney general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n",

I joined the national guard at 17, worked on family farms, and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher. Passionate about it. Young teacher. My first year out, I got the opportunity in the summer of '89 to travel to China--35 years ago, to be able to do that,\" Walz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/abc-debate-moderators-spark-fury-aggressive-fact-checking-trump-easy-treatment-harris\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ABC DEBATE MODERATORS SPARK FURY FOR AGGRESSIVE FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP, EASY TREATMENT OF HARRIS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I came back home and started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams, we would take baseball teams, we would take dancers, and we would go &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/walz-forced-correct-record-whether-he-china-tiananmen-square-protests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;back and forth to China,\"&lt;/a&gt; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/jd-vance-reminds-cbs-moderators-debate-rules-after-try-fact-check-him\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;JD VANCE REMINDS CBS MODERATORS OF DEBATE RULES AFTER THEY TRY TO FACT-CHECK HIM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus group showed support from Republicans, independents and Democrats all going down for Walz during the first portion of his response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Walz recovered among independents and Democrats when he went on to admit that he can be \"a knucklehead at times.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Many times I will talk a lot. I will get caught up in the rhetoric,\" he said, as support from independents rose above 50% in the focus group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH: TOP 5 MOMENTS FROM THE DEBATE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walz's support among Republicans dipped to its lowest point – under 10% – when he said &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; would have benefited from participating in one of his China trips, arguing Trump would never have befriended Chinese President Xi Jinping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News' Sophia Compton and Brooke Curto contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n",

              "<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Vice President Kamala Harris is maintaining her lead over former President Trump in Wisconsin despite Trump leading on the key issues, according to a Wednesday poll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new poll from Marquette Law School finds Harris &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;leading Trump&lt;/a&gt; in a 52%-48% match-up. The poll also found that voters are deeply invested in the election, with 46% of respondents saying they have stopped talking to someone about politics due to the presidential race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marquette conducted the survey from Sept. 18-26, polling 882 Wisconsin registered voters and 798 likely voters. The poll advertises a margin of error of 4.4%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite trailing in the polls, Trump leads Harris in the top issues in the race, including border security, the economy and handling the Israel-Hamas war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/young-swing-state-voters-deliver-advice-kamala-harris-there-needs-more-transparency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;YOUNG SWING STATE VOTERS DELIVER ADVICE FOR KAMALA HARRIS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump enjoys a sizable 49%-37% lead over Harris on immigration. Meanwhile, 50% of Wisconsinites say he will handle the economy better than Harris, with the vice president getting just 42% support. Trump also enjoys a 45%-33% lead when it comes to Israel's conflict in the Middle East. He also has a narrow lead over Harris when it comes to foreign relations more generally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-harris-trump-locked-tight-race-battleground-pennsylvania\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS, TRUMP LOCKED IN TIGHT RACE IN BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris does have a lead over Trump on a number of other issues, however, namely abortion and election concerns. Roughly 53% of respondents said they &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;trusted Harris&lt;/a&gt; to handle the former, compared to 36% for Trump. Another 49% said Harris would be better for ensuring a fair and accurate election, compared to Trump's 39%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin is among a handful of swing states that are likely to determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. Other states like Ohio and Pennsylvania are also critical to either a Trump or Harris victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/pennsylvania\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Pennsylvania in particular&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one of the tightest contests in the nation, where Harris leads Trump in a razor-thin 49%-47% match-up, according to new data from AARP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AARP survey spoke with 1,398 likely voters in Pennsylvania and has an overall margin of error of four percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n",

              "<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In an effort to win the vote of disgruntled Republicans as she battles former President Trump in the race for the White House, &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Vice President Kamala Harris &lt;/a&gt;is heading to the town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior Harris campaign official says that the vice president on Thursday will team up in battleground Wisconsin with &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/person/c/liz-cheney\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney,&lt;/a&gt; a one-time rising conservative star in the GOP who became her party's most visible anti-Trump leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign event will take place in Ripon, Wisconsin, where a one-room schoolhouse was designated a national historic landmark due to its role in holding a series of meetings in 1854 that led to the formation of the Republican Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to her campaign, Harris plans to spotlight the significance of that moment and that place – as she makes another direct appeal to Republican voters frustrated that Trump is their party's presidential nominee - and as she reiterates her pledge to be a president for all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2024-showdown-anti-trump-republican-liz-cheney-says-shes-backing-kamala-harris\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIZ CHENEY WEIGHS IN ON WHOM SHE'LL BACK IN THE 2024 ELECTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris is also expected to praise Cheney for her courage and patriotism in putting country over party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheney, at a speaking event in early September at Duke University in swing state North Carolina, announced that she would be voting for Harris in the presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-ups-his-ante-september-fundraising-haul\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP UPS HIS ANTE IN THE 2024 FUNDRAISING FIGHT WITH HARRIS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"As a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this, and because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Donald Trump,&lt;/a&gt; but I will be voting for Kamala Harris.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheney's father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, also endorsed Harris. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, firing back, has called the endorsements \"irrelevant.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The younger Cheney was once rising in the ranks of House Republican leadership &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she was the most high-profile of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-president Trump in early 2021 on a charge of inciting the deadly Jan. 6th attack on the Capitol, which was waged by right-wing extremists and other Trump supporters who aimed to disrupt congressional certification of President Biden’s Electoral College victory in the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conservative lawmaker and defense hawk immediately came under verbal attack from Trump and his allies, and was eventually ousted from her number-three &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/republicans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;House GOP leadership position&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-lawyers-who-advised-reagan-bush-endorse-harris-over-trump-2024-showdown\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS WHO ADVISED REAGAN AND BUSH BACK HARRIS OVER TRUMP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheney, who has been vocal in emphasizing the importance of defending the nation's democratic process and of putting country before party, was one of only two Republicans who served on a special select committee organized by House Democrats that investigated the riot at the Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, she was ousted in the GOP congressional primary in Wyoming to a candidate that was backed by Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheney — who has argued that the former president is a \"liar,\" a \"con man\" and a potential \"tyrant\" who, if elected again, would \"torch the Constitution\" — vowed after leaving Congress that \"I will do everything I can to make sure [Trump] is never anywhere near the Oval Office again.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Harris campaign says that the vice president, at her event with Cheney, plans to note that while Republicans may not agree with her on every issue, she promises to uphold the Constitution, America’s fundamental principles, and the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cheneys are part of a growing list of prominent Republicans who are supporting Harris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two other high-profile anti-Trump Republicans — former Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan - had speaking roles at the Democratic National Convention, which was held six weeks ago in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Harris is backed by more than 200 alumni who served in both Bush administrations or worked for the late Sen. John McCain and Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2008 and 2012 GOP presidential nominee. She's also supported by more than 100 Republican former national security officials and other prominent Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ripon is not the only town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP. Exeter, New Hampshire also has some bragging rites, as it was the site of meetings in 1853 - a year ahead of the Ripon gatherings - by disenchanted political leaders who discussed the formation of a new party of Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But officials in Ripon said the group in Exeter never actually formed a political organization, or chose officials, as they did &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/wisconsin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;in Wisconsin.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin is one of seven crucial battleground states with razor-thin margins that decided Biden's 2020 White House victory and are likely to determine if Harris or Trump wins the 2024 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With less than five weeks until Election Day in November, Harris and Trump are locked in a margin-of-error race in the key swing states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Trump retains vast sway over the GOP, even a small sliver of Republicans supporting Harris could make an important impact in what will likely be a race within the margins in the battleground states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/elections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n",

              "<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRST ON FOX&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/senate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Dozens of lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; in the House and Senate are calling for more information from the Justice Department about efforts to stop noncitizen voting in federal elections, which they call a \"serious threat\" to election integrity, citing officials in multiple states who have identified noncitizens on their voter rolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A letter from 73 lawmakers, led by Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., and Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., sent to Attorney General Merrick Garland said they were \"deeply concerned\" by reports of noncitizens registering to vote and voting in federal elections and had not received a response from an inquiry in July on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"As of today, there has been no response from you or your Department regarding the inquiry on July 12, 2024, seeking information on efforts undertaken by your Department to enforce laws prohibiting non-citizen voting. Given that the 2024 Presidential Election is in less than 34 days, your Department’s inaction and refusal to provide any information regarding its efforts to promote public trust and confidence in our elections is especially alarming,\" they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, they asked how many aliens have been prosecuted under laws related to noncitizen voting, how the DOJ handles allegations of noncitizen voting or registration and the steps it takes to prevent such practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noncitizens are not allowed to vote, and top Republicans, including former &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;President Trump&lt;/a&gt;, have repeatedly expressed concern that noncitizens may attempt to vote in federal elections, particularly given the influx of immigrants across the southern border in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/doj-illegal-immigrant-stole-us-citizens-identity-vote-multiple-elections-obtain-american-passport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DOJ: ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT STOLE US CITIZEN'S IDENTITY TO VOTE IN MULTIPLE ELECTIONS, OBTAIN AMERICAN PASSPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, Republican lawmakers pushed for the SAVE Act, which aimed to require states to obtain proof of citizenship in person when registering an individual to vote and require states to remove noncitizens from voter rolls, to be attached to a &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-senators-look-tie-crackdown-noncitizen-voting-must-pass-spending-bill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;spending bill extension&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to avoid a government shutdown at the end of the fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawmakers in the letter cited an announcement by the Virginia attorney general that it had identified 6,303 noncitizens on its voter rolls in 2022 and 2023, while Texas had removed &lt;a href=\"https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-announces-over-1-million-ineligible-voters-removed-from-voter-rolls\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"&gt;6,500 noncitizen&lt;/a&gt;s from its voter rolls. Of those, 1,930 had a history of voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DOJ itself announced last month that it had charged an illegal immigrant with stealing a &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/doj-illegal-immigrant-stole-us-citizens-identity-vote-multiple-elections-obtain-american-passport\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;U.S. citizen’s identity&lt;/a&gt; to vote in multiple elections and fraudulently obtain a U.S. passport. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Clearly, there is a non-negligible amount of voter participation by non-citizens in federal elections, which is not only a serious threat to the integrity of our elections and the democratic process they represent, but also has the potential to reduce Americans’ trust and confidence in election results,\" they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/alabama-election-official-says-biden-executive-order-gives-illegal-immigrants-mechanism-register-vote\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ALABAMA ELECTION OFFICIAL SAYS BIDEN EXECUTIVE ORDER GIVES ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 'MECHANISM' TO REGISTER TO VOTE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers quizzed the DOJ on information related to the issue in a July 12 request but had not received a response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also asks what steps the department is taking to prosecute noncitizens registered to vote in the 2024 election. DOJ confirmed to Fox News Digital that it had received the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, the DOJ sued Alabama, alleging the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-sues-alabama-states-top-election-official-allegedly-purging-noncitizen-voters-too-close-election\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;state removed&lt;/a&gt; voters who had been issued noncitizen identification numbers from its election rolls too close to Election Day. The agency argued that officials violated the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dojs-new-voter-roll-guidance-quietly-issued-critic-warns-may-intimidate-election-workers\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Voter Registration Act&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 1993, which requires states to complete any changes to the voter registration lists no later than 90 days before federal elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News' Danielle Wallace and Sarah Rumpf-Whitten contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n",

              "<title>Why Vance easily beat Walz in debate, softening his image in the process</title>\n",
              "<description>White House hopeful JD Vance was the undisputed champion of CBS News&amp;apos; Vice Presidential Debate Tuesday night, according to Fox News&amp;apos; Howard Kurtz.</description>\n",
              "<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It was civil. It was cordial. It was substantive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there’s no question that JD Vance easily won the vice presidential debate. Tim Walz did better than anticipated – perhaps those expectations were deliberately set low – but despite some strong counterpunching, he frequently stumbled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each man had a mission: to defend his running mate and rough up the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;opposing presidential candidate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Vance had a second goal beyond talking &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;up Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;, and that was softening his own image. He made a concerted effort to project empathy, to appear reasonable, to be open to opposing viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/voters-react-gov-tim-walz-dodging-tiananmen-square-question-im-knucklehead-times\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOTERS REACT TO GOV TIM WALZ DODGING TIANANMEN SQUARE QUESTION: 'I'M A KNUCKLEHEAD AT TIMES'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a caricature of the Ohio senator as &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/senate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;a hard-right ideologue&lt;/a&gt; with little sympathy for women, as reflected by the famous childless cat ladies comment. But when the subject of abortion came up, he went out of his way to sound sympathetic to the pro-choice side:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I know a lot of Americans don't agree with everything that I've ever said on this topic. And, you know, I grew up in a working-class family in a neighborhood where I knew a lot of young women who had unplanned pregnancies and decided to terminate those pregnancies because they feel like they didn't have any other options. And, you know, one of them is actually very dear to me. And I know she's watching tonight and I love you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"And she told me something a couple of years ago that she felt like if she hadn't &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/abortion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;had that abortion&lt;/a&gt;, that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship. And I think that what I take from that as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable, is that my party? We've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they frankly just don't trust us.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Vance’s website describes him as \"100 percent pro-life.\")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walz countered with specific stories of women who died or whose health was damaged because they lived in states that tightly restrict abortion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Minnesota governor hit his talking points, but regularly took a long time to get to his main argument. A question about Kamala Harris’ plan to build 3 million housing units produced a detour about how Walz has only bought one home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/watch-voters-react-real-time-key-vance-walz-debate-moments-immigration-democracy-abortion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH: VOTERS REACT IN REAL TIME TO KEY VANCE-WALZ DEBATE MOMENTS ON IMMIGRATION, DEMOCRACY, ABORTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walz often spoke in a clipped shorthand – the ACA, Springfield, Vance creating stories – without explaining, for instance, that he meant the false tale of Haitian migrants eating pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CBS moderators, Norah O’Donnell and Margaret Brennan, edged into ABC territory &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;by fact-checking&lt;/a&gt; only Vance, despite saying they would try to avoid that. After the senator referred to illegal immigrants in the Ohio town, Brennan said Springfield \"does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected.\" That’s a point Walz should have made, but didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many questions were framed from the left. \"Senator Vance,\" said Brennan, \"you oppose most gun legislation that Democrats claim would curb gun violence. You oppose red flag gun laws and legislation to ban certain semi-automatic rifles, including AR-15s.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walz’s worst moment was one he should have anticipated, a story in the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere saying he was not in China for the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests as he had claimed, but got to Hong Kong months later. The governor began with a word-salad answer about growing up in Nebraska before retreating to \"I’ve not been perfect. And I'm a knucklehead at times.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pressed again, he said he had misspoken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vance’s worst moment was about Jan. 6. O’Donnell began, \"You have said you would not have certified the last presidential election and would have asked the states to submit alternative electors that has been called unconstitutional and illegal.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/shows/media-buzz/politics-hijacks-hurricane-devastation-south-biden-calls-trump-liar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POLITICS HIJACKS HURRICANE DEVASTATION IN THE SOUTH, BIDEN CALLS TRUMP A LIAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senator countered that Trump \"said that on January the 6th, the protesters ought to protest peacefully. And on January the 20th, what happened? Joe Biden became the president. Donald Trump left the White House.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time Walz was ready. Trump \"lost this election and he said he did. 140 police officers were beaten at the Capitol that day, some with the American flag. Several later died.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He turned to Vance and said: \"Did he lose the 2020 election?\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Vance tried the \"focused on the future\" line again, Walz called that \"a damning non-answer.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Vance largely came off as a Bush-style compassionate conservative. He must figure that win or lose, he’ll be running for president in 2028 and needed to combat all the negative coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walz looked like a man who was happy to survive his turn on the national stage. The debate would have looked very different if Harris had picked Josh Shapiro, given that she’s tied with Trump in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Harris campaign has bubble-wrapped Tim Walz, not allowing him to do a single solo interview. JD Vance is constantly doing interviews, podcasts and press conferences, the best kind of preparation for a big debate. And that, in the end, may have been the difference.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n",

Tim Walz said Democrat nominee Vice President Harris' \"steady leadership\" in the region is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"What we've seen out of Vice President Harris is we've seen steady leadership. We've seen a calmness that is able to be able to draw on the coalitions, to bring them together, understanding that our allies matter. When our allies see Donald Trump turn towards Vladimir Putin, turn towards North Korea, when we start to see that type of fickleness around holding the coalitions together, we will stay committed,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"And as the vice president said today, we will protect our forces and our allied forces, and there will be consequences,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vance voiced support for GOP nominee former President Trump's \"peace through strength\" policy toward Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you need peace through strength,\" Vance said. \"They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States' global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vance said it is \"up to Israel\" how they choose to respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Now, you asked about a preemptive strike, Margaret, and I want to answer the question,\" he said during the debate. \"Look, it is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe,\" he said. \"And we should support our allies wherever they are when they're fighting the bad guys.

              "<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A federal judge on Wednesday blocked a California bill that outlaws &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/artificial-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;AI-generated \"deepfake\"&lt;/a&gt; content and required the removal of \"deceptive content\" from social media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preliminary injunction comes just two weeks after Democratic Gov. &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/gavin-newsom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Gavin Newsom&lt;/a&gt; signed the controversial measure into law, igniting a spat with X owner and Tesla CEO &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elon-musk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;. It also comes roughly a month before Election Day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hamilton Lincoln Law Institute had filed a lawsuit on behalf of Christopher Kohls, known as \"Mr Reagan\" online, who created satirical political videos, including one calling out the governor targeted as being \"illegal\" under the bill he signed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, Reagan argued that the bill was unconstitutional. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The court agreed, granting a preliminary injunction that finds California has no ‘license to bulldoze over the longstanding tradition of critique, parody, and satire protected by the First Amendment,’\" HLLI said in a &lt;a href=\"https://hlli.org/hlli-triumphs-in-mr-reagan-free-speech-case-protecting-satirical-parody-and-political-speech-rights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;. \"HLLI does not know whether California intends to appeal.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/800-bills-left-newsoms-desk-illustrate-californias-overregulation-problem-experts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;800-PLUS BILLS LEFT ON NEWSOM'S DESK ILLUSTRATE CALIFORNIA'S OVERREGULATION PROBLEM: EXPERTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Newsom’s office warned that deepfakes \"threaten the integrity of our elections, and these new laws protect our democracy while preserving free speech — in a manner no more stringent than those in other states, including deep-red Alabama.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We’re confident the courts will uphold the state's ability to regulate these types of dangerous and misleading deepfakes,\" the governor’s office said in a statement to Fox News Digital, noting that \"Satire remains alive and well in California — even for those who miss the punchline.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital's Jamie Joseph contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n",

              "<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former President Trump blasted the Justice Department Wednesday for having \"disobeyed their own rule in favor of complete and total election interference\" after a &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-unseals-key-filing-special-counsels-election-case-against-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;key filing&lt;/a&gt; from Special Counsel Jack Smith’s election case against him was unsealed with just weeks before Americans cast their ballots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Tanya Chutkan unsealed &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-unseals-key-filing-special-counsels-election-case-against-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Smith’s 165-page filing&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday afternoon. The filing lays out his case and the alleged evidence he intends to use in an eventual trial against Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges brought by Smith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-unseals-key-filing-special-counsels-election-case-against-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUDGE UNSEALS KEY FILING IN SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH'S ELECTION CASE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Trump blasted the Justice Department Wednesday evening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"For 60 days prior to an election, the Department of Injustice is supposed to do absolutely nothing that would taint or interfere with a case,\" Trump posted in all capital letters to his Truth Social. \"They disobeyed their own rule in favor of complete and total election interference.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I did nothing wrong, they did!\" he continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOJ practice during an election year has often been to hold off on major actions in cases that could impact elections during the 60 days leading up to Election Day, an unwritten policy commonly referred to as the \"60-day rule.\" The \"rule,\" which is really more of a tradition because it is not an actual rule, has been cited many times in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The case is a scam, just like all of the others, including the documents case, which was dismissed!\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump was pointing to the other case Smith brought against him related to classified records. The case was tossed out by a federal judge in Florida who ruled that Smith was unlawfully appointed as special counsel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former president further blasted Democrats, saying they are \"weaponizing the Justice Department against me because they I know I am WINNING, and they are desperate to prop up their failing candidate, Kamala Harris.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump said the unsealing of the Smith filing, which he called the \"latest ‘hit job,’\" happened because his running mate, Sen. JD Vance \"humiliated\" Harris’ running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz during Tuesday night’s vice presidential debate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump said the Justice Department \"has become nothing more than an extension of Joe’s, and now Kamala’s, campaign.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-trial-stemming-from-jack-smiths-probe-delayed-past-election-day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP TRIAL STEMMING FROM JACK SMITH'S PROBE DELAYED PAST ELECTION DAY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This is egregious PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT, and should not have been released right before the Election,\" Trump said. \"The Democrat Party is turning America into a Third World Country that tries to censor, harass, and intimidate their Political Opponents. What they have done to our Justice System is one of the Great, All Time, Tragedies.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former president added that the Democrat Party \"is guilty of the Worst Election Interference in American History.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"They are trying to DESTROY OUR DEMOCRACY, allowing millions of people to enter our Country illegally. They are determined to stop us from winning back the White House, sealing the Border, and MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. BUT THEY WILL FAIL, AND WE WILL SAVE OUR NATION!\" Trump posted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump also blasted Smith as \"deranged,\" and said that he, the \"Harris-Biden DOJ, and Washington, D.C. based Radical Left Democrats, are \"HELL BENT on continuing to Weaponize the Justice Department in an attempt to cling to power.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"'TRUMP' is dominating the Election cycle, leading in the Polls, and the Radical Democrats throughout the Deep State are totally ‘freaking out.’ This entire case is a Partisan, Unconstitutional, Witch Hunt, that should be dismissed, entirely, just like the Florida case was dismissed!\" Trump said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s comments came in response to Smith's newly-unsealed filing, in which he alleges Trump \"resorted to crimes to try to stay in office\" after losing the 2020 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"With private co-conspirators, the defendant launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn the legitimate election results in seven states that he had lost — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,\" Smith wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"His efforts included lying to state officials in order to induce them to ignore true vote counts; manufacturing fraudulent electoral votes in the targeted states; attempting to enlist Vice President Michael R. Pence, in his role as President of the Senate, to obstruct &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Congress’s certification&lt;/a&gt; of the election by using the defendant’s fraudulent electoral votes; and when all else had failed, on January 6, 2021, directing an angry crowd of supporters to the United States Capitol to obstruct the congressional certification.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith claims that the \"throughline of these efforts was deceit,\" claiming Trump and co-conspirators engaged in a conspiracy to interfere with the federal government function by which the nation collects and counts election results, which is set forth in the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act (ECA); a conspiracy to obstruct the official proceeding in which Congress certifies the legitimate results of the presidential election; and a conspiracy against the rights of millions of Americans to vote and have their votes counted.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that a president is immune from prosecution for official acts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-indicted-second-time-election-subversion-case-brought-special-counsel-jack-smith\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP INDICTED A SECOND TIME IN ELECTION SUBVERSION CASE BROUGHT BY SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith was then required to file another indictment against Trump, revising the charges in an effort to navigate the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/supreme-court\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ruling. The new indictment kept the prior criminal charges but narrowed and reframed allegations against Trump after the high court’s ruling that gave broad immunity to former presidents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges in the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/in-court\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new indictment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital the release of the \"falsehood-ridden, unconstitutional J6 brief immediately following Tim Walz’s disastrous debate performance is another obvious attempt by the Harris-Biden regime to undermine American Democracy and interfere in this election.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Deranged Jack Smith and Washington DC Radical Democrats are hell-bent on weaponizing the Justice Department in an attempt to cling to power,\" Cheung said. \"President Trump is dominating, and the Radical Democrats throughout the Deep State are freaking out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This entire case is a partisan, Unconstitutional Witch Hunt that should be dismissed entirely, together with ALL of the remaining Democrat hoaxes.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Chutkan said she would not hold the trial for Trump on charges stemming from Smith's Jan. 6 investigation until after the 2024 presidential election. She set deadlines for replies and paperwork from federal prosecutors and Trump's legal team for Nov. 7 — after Election Day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News' Jake Gibson contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n",

              "<description>Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Wednesday traded barbs over Tuesday night&amp;apos;s vice presidential debate during campaign stops in Pennsylvania and Michigan.</description>\n",
              "<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;YORK, Pa. — The day after their vice presidential debate in New York City, Republican &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/jd-vance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Sen. JD Vance of Ohio&lt;/a&gt; and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz jumped back on the campaign trail with stops in two crucial battleground states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he arrived at the airport near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, Walz pointed toward &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/presidential-debate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;his debate &lt;/a&gt;hours earlier with Vance and told reporters, \"New York City was a little crazy last night.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most pundits said Vance was the more polished of the two candidates on the vice presidential debate stage Tuesday night, although flash polls indicated debate watchers were mostly divided on which running mate was victorious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An accidental response by Walz during the debate quickly went viral, as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate mistakenly said he had \"become friends with school shooters.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-trump-cash-dash-former-president-flip-script-fundraising-swing-oil-country\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2024 CASH DASH: TRUMP UPS HIS ANTE AS HE TRIES TO CLOSE GAP WITH HARRIS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mishap occurred when Walz was asked about changing positions on banning assault weapons, which he previously opposed but now supports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I sat in that office with those Sandy Hook parents. I’ve become friends with school shooters. I’ve seen it,\" Walz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked to clarify his debate gaffe, Walz said Wednesday, \"I'm super passionate about this. The question came up about the school shooting. We're talking about everything except school shootings. And I sat as a member of Congress with the Sandy Hook parents, and it was a profound movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"David Hogg [a leading gun control activist and school shooting survivor] is a good friend of mine.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vance-walz-spar-abortion-immigration-first-only-vp-debate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VANCE, WALZ, SPAR OVER ISSUES AT VP DEBATE SHOWDOWN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walz acknowledged, \"I need to be more specific on that. But I am passionate about this.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vance, speaking at a rally in &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/michigan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Auburn Hills, Michigan,&lt;/a&gt; said he didn't hear Walz's comment until he was told about it during a conversation with his running mate, former President Trump, after the debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He said that Tim Walz said that he was friends with school shooters twice,\" Vance said, referencing his&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt; conversation with Trump.&lt;/a&gt; \"And that's something I actually didn't notice that Tim Walz had said that on the debate stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I said, ‘Did he really say that, sir?’ And he [Trump] said, 'I'm telling you, man, go and watch the clips.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-harris-head-hurricane-ravaged-southeast-wake-trump-visit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HARRIS, BIDEN, HEAD TO STORM-RAVAGED SOUTHEAST IN WAKE OF TRUMP TRIP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"And I said that was probably only the third- or fourth-dumbest comment Tim Walz made that night.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate moderators also confronted Walz on his claim to have been in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walz admitted he traveled to Asia in August 1989, several months after the April 15 protests began and also after the June massacre, adding he can be \"a knucklehead at times.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governor on Wednesday reiterated that he had his \"dates wrong.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-walz-embarrassed-himself-compared-vances-brilliance-vp-debate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Trump, in an interview Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; with Fox News' Brooke Singman, called his running mate's performance \"fantastic\" and that it had \"reconfirmed my choice.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former president also argued that Walz had \"embarrassed himself\" during the debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another major moment in the debate came near the end, when Vance wouldn't say that President Biden won the 2020 election over Trump. The former president for four years has repeatedly made unproven claims that the election was rigged and rampant with voter fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walz, on Wednesday, once again emphasized that \"it is disqualifying to not acknowledge that the 2020 election was won by Joe Biden. It's as simple as that.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An hour later, speaking to a large crowd at a rally at the York Fairgrounds, Walz charged that \"you can't rewrite history. And trying to mislead us about Donald Trump's record. That's gaslighting.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vance, asked about his avoidance of answering the 2020 election question during the debate, reiterated his charge on Wednesday that \"the simple reason\" is that \"the media is obsessed with talking about the election of four years ago. I'm focused on the election of 33 days from now because I want to throw Kamala Harris out of office and get back to commonsense, economic policies.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walz arrived at his rally in York to cheers as he pulled into the York Exposition Center riding his campaign bus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But York is Trump country. The former president won York County by roughly 25 points over Biden in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walz's &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/pennsylvania\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Pennsylvania swing &lt;/a&gt;through Harrisburg, York and Reading kicked off what the Harris campaign described as a more aggressive post-debate travel and voter engagement blitz by the governor, with stops in two other battleground states — Arizona and Nevada — and a fundraising blitz in Ohio, California and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the campaign noted that Walz would participate in more media interviews. Vance has done dozens of interviews and repeatedly fielded questions from reporters on the campaign trail since Trump named the senator as his running mate two and a half months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vance made the first of his two stops in Michigan in Auburn Hills at Visioneering, an automotive industry tool supplier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auburn Hills is in Oakland County, which has swung heavily toward the Democrats in recent election cycles. Biden carried the county by roughly 14 points over Trump four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michigan and Pennsylvania are two of seven key battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020 victory over Trump and will likely determine whether Trump or Harris win the 2024 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News' Deirdre Heavey and Kirill Clark contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/elections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n",

              "<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., took matters into his own hands and launched a rescue mission in North Carolina this week with other good Samaritans, providing crucial assistance to victims of Hurricane Helene and delivering essential supplies to those affected &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-residents-fight-survival-basic-goods-become-scarce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;by the disaster.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It makes sense that Americans come together in times of grief and strife and difficulty, and I don't think that's ever really changed,\" &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/person/m/cory-mills\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Mills, an Army combat veteran&lt;/a&gt;, told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"I mean, we're not defined by the federal government, we're defined by ‘We the People.'\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time Mills has taken on a rescue mission. In addition to providing relief to Israelis after Oct. 7, he also provided support during &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/weather/hurricanes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Hurricanes Nicole and Ian&lt;/a&gt; in his own district and rescued 23 Americans along with 59 mentally and physically disabled children in Haiti. He also conducted one of the first successful overland rescues during the Afghanistan withdrawal, totaling around two to three dozen rescues in that region in 2021 alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/rescue-missions-underway-north-carolina-after-hurricane-helene-brings-historic-flooding-landslides\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;RESCUE MISSIONS UNDERWAY IN NORTH CAROLINA AFTER HURRICANE HELENE BRINGS ‘HISTORIC’ FLOODING, LANDSLIDES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The federal government, with its bureaucracy, moves too slow for the pace in which emergencies and often chaos actually moves,\" Mills said. \"And so, I think that it's good that since Afghanistan and the failed botched withdrawal in 2021 you've seen a larger group of civilians who are coming together, a lot of which are former military or law enforcement, to pick up a slack and help as needed.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mills partnered with a private helicopter company, Mercury One, to deliver food, water, diapers, non-perishables, insulin medication and oxygen since Monday. According to Mills, he and a small group have already delivered thousands of pounds of supplies in the region's hardest hit areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;The congressman&lt;/a&gt; used two helicopters and also helped orchestrate search and rescues in Bernardsville, Poplar, Burnsville and the surrounding areas. He did a hoist operation of an elderly man on Tuesday, a spokesperson told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/franklin-graham-samaritans-purse-help-suffering-hurricane-helene\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;THOSE SUFFERING FROM HURRICANE HELENE'S IMPACT GET HELP FROM REV. FRANKLIN GRAHAM AND SAMARITAN'S PURSE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Anytime there's any type of devastation or Americans that are in jeopardy, obviously it's, it's piqued my attention, and we need to be able to do a response to that in some way,\" Mills said. \"I feel like, as an elected official sort of like a responsibility to try and do what I can to help the American people, regardless if you live in Florida's 7th District or anywhere in the country.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By partnering with some local response teams on the ground, Mills said he and his group mapped out a couple of different areas to target to bring much needed aid to those who are coming up on day five without essentials, including cell service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rescue teams have also been deployed to parts of eastern Tennessee,&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/south-carolina\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt; South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, Georgia, Virginia and Florida – areas that were also devastated by the storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/weather\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON HELENE'S HAVOC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of thousands more remain without power and cell service, which has led to delays in locals getting help and trying to get in touch with loved ones &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/planet-earth/natural-disasters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;affected by the hurricane&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helene's death toll for North Carolina and Tennessee is unknown as authorities continue to respond and get in touch with families before publicizing official numbers, but the lack of data roaming and cellphone service is making that difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital's Audrey Conklin contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n",

              "<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia Tanya Chutkan on Wednesday unsealed a key filing in &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-indicted-second-time-election-subversion-case-brought-special-counsel-jack-smith\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Special Counsel Jack Smith’s&lt;/a&gt; election case against former President Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chutkan unsealed Smith’s 165-page filing after the special counsel&lt;a&gt; &lt;/a&gt;submitted the document, in which he lays out the case and alleged evidence he intends to use in an eventual trial against Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Trump pleaded not guilty&lt;/a&gt; to all charges brought against him by Smith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, himself, fired back against Smith on Wednesday blasting the case as 2024 election interference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Democrats are Weaponizing the Justice Department against me because they know I am WINNING, and they are desperate to prop up their failing Candidate, Kamala Harris,\" Trump posted on his Truth Social. \"The DOJ pushed out this latest ‘hit job’ today because JD Vance humiliated Tim Walz last night in the Debate.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump said the DOJ \"has become nothing more than an extension of Joe’s, and now Kamala’s, Campaign.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This is egregious PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT, and should not have been released right before the Election,\" Trump said. \"The Democrat Party is turning America into a Third World Country that tries to censor, harass, and intimidate their Political Opponents. What they have done to our Justice System is one of the Great, All Time, Tragedies.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former president added that the Democrat Party \"is guilty of the Worst Election Interference in American History.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"They are trying to DESTROY OUR DEMOCRACY, allowing millions of people to enter our Country illegally. They are determined to stop us from winning back the White House, sealing the Border, and MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. BUT THEY WILL FAIL, AND WE WILL SAVE OUR NATION!\" Trump posted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump also blasted Smith as \"deranged,\" and said that he, the \"Harris-Biden DOJ, and Washington, D.C. based Radical Left Democrats, are \"HELL BENT on continuing to Weaponize the Justice Department in an attempt to cling to power.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"'TRUMP' is dominating the Election cycle, leading in the Polls, and the Radical Democrats throughout the Deep State are totally ‘freaking out.’ This entire case is a Partisan, Unconstitutional, Witch Hunt, that should be dismissed, entirely, just like the Florida case was dismissed!\" Trump said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-indicted-second-time-election-subversion-case-brought-special-counsel-jack-smith\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP INDICTED A SECOND TIME IN ELECTION SUBVERSION CASE BROUGHT BY SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that a president is immune from prosecution for official acts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith was then required to file another indictment against Trump, revising the charges in an effort to navigate the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/supreme-court\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; ruling. The new indictment kept the prior criminal charges but narrowed and reframed allegations against Trump after the high court’s ruling that gave broad immunity to former presidents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges in the &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/events/in-court\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;new indictment&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the filing unsealed Wednesday, Smith outlines a \"factual proffer,\" alleging Trump \"resorted to crimes to try to stay in office\" after losing the 2020 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"With private co-conspirators, the defendant launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn the legitimate election results in seven states that he had lost — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,\" Smith wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"His efforts included lying to state officials in order to induce them to ignore true vote counts; manufacturing fraudulent electoral votes in the targeted states; attempting to enlist Vice President Michael R. Pence, in his role as President of the Senate, to obstruct &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Congress’s certification&lt;/a&gt; of the election by using the defendant’s fraudulent electoral votes; and when all else had failed, on January 6, 2021, directing an angry crowd of supporters to the United States Capitol to obstruct the congressional certification.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith claims that the \"throughline of these efforts was deceit,\" claiming Trump and co-conspirators engaged in a conspiracy to interfere with the federal government function by which the nation collects and counts election results, which is set forth in the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act (ECA); a conspiracy to obstruct the official proceeding in which Congress certifies the legitimate results of the presidential election; and a conspiracy against the rights of millions of Americans to vote and have their votes counted.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital the release of the \"falsehood-ridden, unconstitutional J6 brief immediately following Tim Walz’s disastrous debate performance is another obvious attempt by the Harris-Biden regime to undermine American Democracy and interfere in this election.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Deranged Jack Smith and Washington DC Radical Democrats are hell-bent on weaponizing the Justice Department in an attempt to cling to power,\" Cheung said. \"President Trump is dominating, and the Radical Democrats throughout the Deep State are freaking out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This entire case is a partisan, Unconstitutional Witch Hunt that should be dismissed entirely, together with ALL of the remaining Democrat hoaxes.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the filing, Smith lays out his findings, claiming that people close to Trump had tried to tell him that the claims were all \"bulls---.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith details conversations between an unnamed Trump personal attorney and the former president. That attorney allegedly told Trump that the campaign was \"looking into his fraud claims and had even hired external experts to do so, but could find no support for them.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-trial-stemming-from-jack-smiths-probe-delayed-past-election-day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP TRIAL STEMMING FROM JACK SMITH'S PROBE DELAYED PAST ELECTION DAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He told the defendant that if the Campaign took these claims to court, they would get slaughtered because the claims are all ‘bullsh---,’\" the filing states, with Smith claiming that a lawyer discussed with Trump the investigations and \"debunkings on all major claims.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith also details alleged interactions between Trump and Pence in the days following the election. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith details a Nov. 7, 2020, call between Pence and Trump in which Pence allegedly \"tried to encourage\" Trump \"as a friend\" by reminding him that he \"took a dying political party and gave it a new lease on life.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith also details a private lunch between Trump and Pence on Nov. 12, 2020, in which Pence allegedly gave Trump a \"face-saving option.\" That option, according to the filing, was \"don’t concede but recognize the process is over.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith also detailed another private lunch between Trump and Pence on Nov. 16, 2020, in which Pence allegedly tried to encourage Trump to accept the results of the election and run again in 2024. Trump allegedly said at the time: \"I don’t know, 2024 is so far off.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith details another private lunch between the two in which Pence allegedly \"encouraged\" Trump \"not to look at the election as a loss — just an intermission.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith wrote that, after that lunch, Trump allegedly asked Pence in the Oval Office, \"What do you think we should do?\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pence allegedly said, \"After we have exhausted every legal process in the courts and Congress, if we still came up short, [the defendant] should ‘take a bow.’\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Smith claims a White House staffer traveling with Trump overheard him tell his family members that \"it doesn’t matter if you won or lost the election. You still have to fight like hell.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith claims Trump \"was on notice that there was no evidence of widespread election fraud in Arizona within a week of the election\" and claimed Trump also \"had early notice that his claims of election fraud in Georgia were false.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith claims that \"none of the allegations or evidence is protected by presidential immunity,\" arguing that Trump's \"scheme was a private one.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He extensively used private actors and his campaign infrastructure to attempt to overturn the election results and operated in a private capacity as a candidate for office,\" Smith claimed. \"To the limited extent that the superseding indictment and proffered evidence reflect official conduct, however, the Government can rebut the presumption of immunity because relying on that conduct in this prosecution will not pose a danger of intrusion on the authority or functions of the Executive Branch.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Chutkan said she would not hold the trial for Trump on charges stemming from Smith's Jan. 6 investigation until after the 2024 presidential election. She set deadlines for replies and paperwork from federal prosecutors and Trump's legal team for Nov. 7 — after Election Day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News' Bill Mears and David Spunt contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n",

              "<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Former President Trump's &lt;/a&gt;campaign on Wednesday said that they hauled in over $160 million in fundraising in September, in figures shared with Fox News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The haul by the former president's campaign is up from the roughly $130 million that Trump's various fundraising committees brought in during the month of August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump faces a large fundraising deficit to &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Vice President Kamala Harris&lt;/a&gt;, with just under five weeks to go until Election Day in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-trump-cash-dash-former-president-flip-script-fundraising-swing-oil-country\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AIMS TO FLIP THE SCRIPT ON THE CASH DASH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Harris campaign announced last month that it raked in a staggering $361 million in August, nearly triple Trump's fundraising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Harris campaign has yet to report its September &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/fundraising\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;fundraising figures.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/power-rankings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS SHOW IN THE 2024 ELECTION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump campaign, in revealing its fundraising numbers, said that it had $283.1 million cash-on-hand as of the end of September. That's down slightly from the $295 million it had in its coffers a month earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Harris campaign, in its announcement last month, reported $404 million cash-on-hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump's team, in releasing their latest figures, showcased their small-dollar grassroots fundraising, saying the average donation they received was $60 and that 96% of their contributions were less than $200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"In September, nearly 2.5 million donations under $200 were made. These supporters have allowed us to bank the funds we need as we move into the campaign’s final weeks. Our momentum continues to grow from supporters and donors across the country as we enter the homestretch toward victory,\" Trump campaign senior adviser Brian Hughes told Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee enjoyed a fundraising lead over Trump and the Republican National Committee earlier this year. But Trump and the RNC topped Biden and the DNC by $331 million to $264 million during the second quarter of 2024 fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden enjoyed a brief fundraising surge after his disastrous performance in his late June debate with Trump as donors briefly shelled out big bucks in a sign of support for the 81-year-old president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Biden's halting and shaky debate delivery also instantly fueled questions about his physical and mental ability to serve another four years in the White House and spurred a rising chorus of calls from within his own party for the president to end his bid for a second term. The brief surge in fundraising didn't last and, by early July, began to significantly slow down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biden bowed out of the 2024 race on July 21, and the party quickly consolidated around Harris, who instantly saw her fundraising soar, spurred by small-dollar donations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about the fundraising deficit, &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/republicans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RNC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; chair Michael Whatley told Fox News Digital last month that \"the Democrats have a ton of money. The Democrats always have a ton of money.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he emphasized that \"we absolutely have the resources that we need to get our message out to all the voters that we’re talking to and feel very comfortable that we’re going to be able to see this campaign through, and we’re going to win on November 5.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundraising, along with polling, is a key metric in campaign politics and a measure of a candidate's popularity and their campaign's strength. The money raised can be used — among other things — to hire staff; expand grassroots outreach and get-out-the-vote efforts; pay to produce and run ads on TV, radio, digital and mailers; and for candidate travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/elections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n",

JD Vance&lt;/a&gt; and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz had a largely positive response to an exchange between the two vice presidential candidates on shootings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I got a 17-year-old, and he witnessed a shooting at a community center playing volleyball. Those things don’t leave you,\" Walz said, eliciting a response of \"awful\" from Vance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer from Walz on shootings began a portion of largely positive reactions from viewers of the debate &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/tim-walz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;as Walz&lt;/a&gt; explained his stance on gun safety measures, according to Fox News dials of Republican, Democratic and Independent voters that measured their responses to the candidates answers in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/walz-repeats-georgia-abortion-death-falsehood-decried-doctors-fearmongering\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I’m a hunter. I own firearms. The vice president is — we understand that the Second Amendment is there, but our first responsibility is to our kids to figure this out,\" Walz said, eliciting an increasingly positive response from Independent and Democratic voters while Republicans remained mostly in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three groups of voters showed an increasingly positive response to Walz's remarks as he acknowledged Vance in a rare bipartisan moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vance-walz-spar-on-immigration-during-vp-debate-been-to-the-border-more-than-our-border-czar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I 100% believe that Sen. Vance hates it when these kids… it’s abhorrent, and it breaks your heart. I agree with that, but that’s not far enough when we know there’s things that work,\" Walz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent and &lt;a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/republicans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"&gt;Republican voters&lt;/a&gt; also started to have a positive response when Vance was given the opportunity to respond to Walz’s remarks, with the Ohio senator calling it \"awful\" that the Minnesota governor’s son witnessed a shooting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Tim, first of all, I didn’t know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting, and I’m sorry about that. Christ have mercy,\" Vance said, receiving a heartfelt thank you from Walz while garnering a positive response from voters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n",

            "         Iranian hackers sought to interest President Biden's campaign in information stolen from the rival campaign of former President Donald Trump, sending unsolicited emails to people connected to the Democratic president in an effort to interfere in the 2024 election, the FBI and other federal agencies said Wednesday. There's no evidence that any of the recipients responded, officials said, preventing the hacked information from surfacing in the final months of the closely contested election. The hackers sent emails in late June and early July to people who were associated with Mr. Biden's campaign before he dropped out. The emails \"contained an excerpt taken from stolen, non-public material from former President Trump's campaign as text in the emails,\" according to a U.S. government statement. In late July, officials with the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Homeland Security said that Tehran had started a campaign that was working to weaken Trump's candidacy, while Russia was attempting to do the opposite.  Last month, sources told CBS News that the FBI was investigating whether Iranian hackers had targeted people associated with both the Trump and Biden-Harris campaigns.  In response to the revelation, Harris campaign spokesperson Morgan Finkelstein told CBS News in a statement Wednesday evening that \"we're not aware of any material being sent directly to the campaign,\" adding that \"a few individuals were targeted on their personal emails with what looked like a spam or phishing attempt.\" Finkelstein said the campaign has \"cooperated with the appropriate law enforcement authorities since we were made aware that individuals associated with the then-Biden campaign were among the intended victims of this foreign influence operation.\" Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told CBS News in a statement that \"this is further proof the Iranians are actively interfering in the election to help Kamala Harris and Joe Biden because they know President Trump will restore his tough sanctions and stand against their reign of terror.\" A Microsoft threat intelligence report last month provided examples about the actions of Iranian groups seeking to influence the 2024 election.   \"Not surprisingly, the latest revelations confirm that Iran's efforts are multi-pronged and intended to damage the Trump campaign,\" Chris Krebs, former Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director, told CBS News Wednesday. \"This comes on the same day as a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on foreign threats to elections. In that hearing Microsoft President Brad Smith characterized the state of foreign interference as Russia vs Harris and Iran vs Trump.\"   The Trump campaign disclosed on Aug. 10 that it had been hacked and said Iranian actors had stolen and distributed sensitive internal documents. At least three news outlets — Politico, The New York Times and The Washington Post — were leaked confidential material from inside the Trump campaign. So far, each has refused to reveal any details about what it received. Politico reported that it began receiving emails on July 22 from an anonymous account. The source —an AOL email account identified only as \"Robert\"— passed along what appeared to be a research dossier that the campaign had apparently done on the Republican vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. The document was dated Feb. 23, almost five months before Trump selected Vance as his running mate. A spokesperson for Iran's permanent mission to the U.N. told CBS News in a statement Wednesday that the FBI's \"allegations\" were \"fundamentally unfounded, and wholly inadmissible.\" \"Having already unequivocally and repeatedly announced, Iran neither has any motive nor intent to interfere in the U.S. election; and, it therefore categorically repudiates such accusations,\" the statement read. \"Should the U.S. government genuinely seek the truth, it is incumbent upon them to formally and transparently provide their substantiated evidence, so as to receive a corresponding and precise response.\" \n",

            "While New York is seen as a solid blue state, the Republican party still enjoys widespread support in its rural and suburban areas, and this year the gap between the GOP and the Democrat Party could be narrowing. In the 2024 presidential election, Donald Trump has the potential to gain the largest share of the vote in the Empire State than any other Republican candidate since 1988, some polls have suggested. Trump's very unlikely to win the state and get its 28 electoral votes, but a good performance in the Democratic stronghold gives Republicans a new message to bring to voters and enthusiasm about Trump could help the GOP in down ballot races. Before his rally on Long Island Wednesday night, Trump told supporters in a Manhattan bar that he was going to \"win New York!\" – a message he repeated to the crowd later on. \"When I told some people in Washington that I'm going up to New York, we're doing a campaign speech, they said, 'What do you mean New York? You can't ever ... Republicans can't win New York,\" Trump said at the Nassau Coliseum. \"I said, 'I can win New York,'\" he continued. \"We can win New York. We're going to win New York ... Your love for your state will come roaring back.\" In two polls that pit Trump against Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's support ranges from 41.7 percent to 42 percent. That puts Trump in a position to possibly break his own record in New York and get more support than any Republican since 1988. Siena College's latest survey of New York voters, released on Thursday, showed Harris leading Trump 55 percent to 42 percent. Trump's support in the Empire State appeared to be holding steady from August, according to Siena College's polling. New York voters said they trust the vice president more on abortion, democracy and the economy, while the key issue of immigration essentially tied the pair – Harris on 48 percent and Trump on 47 percent. \"New York remains solidly 'blue' but perhaps not as deep blue as it has been in the last several presidential cycles,\" Siena College pollster Steven Greenberg said in a press release. Greenberg said that in the six presidential elections this century, Democrats have carried New York by at least 18 points, but Harris currently only leads by 13. \"Despite the Democratic convention, the debate and numerous other events during the six weeks between Siena College polls, there has been little movement in the horse race or in either candidate's favorability rating,\" Greenberg added. An earlier poll in August, by ActiVote, showed a greater lead for Harris, who was ahead by 16.6%. Trump was beating Harris among rural New York voters, with 52% supporting him. \"Independents moved further in Trump's direction, supporting him over Harris 58-34%, up from 47-40% last month,\" Greenberg explained. If polling holds true in the election, it would put Trump at more of an advantage than he enjoyed in the previous two elections, but the Queens native still would not have enough support to win the state on November 5. Four years ago, Trump lost to President Joe Biden with 37.7 percent of the vote compared to 60.9 percent. It was a very similar picture against former Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in 2016. In 1988, former President George H.W. Bush received 47.52 percent of the state's vote, narrowly losing it to Michael Dukakis' 51.62 percent. No Republican has been able to match Bush's support in New York since. In the next two elections, former President Bill Clinton had a 15 and then an almost 30-point lead over his GOP rivals. Former President George W. Bush lost New York by similar margins, as did former Senators John McCain and Mitt Romney.  Republicans winning New York would upend the Electoral College for Democrats, but the likelihood of that happening is very slim. However, Trump doesn't need to win the state to help his party. Targeting New York could still be beneficial for the GOP when it comes to House races, especially in areas like Long Island where support for the party is greater than within New York City. Polling from 538 showed Representative Anthony D'Esposito's Democratic rival Laura Gillen leading him by three points in August (50-47%), but earlier numbers showed him ahead by five (48-42%). \"While New York perhaps is not a battleground state, Long Island is a battleground island,\" D'Esposito told Politico. \"It does benefit him, because as president, he's going to need a majority in the House, and those seats that we're defending on Long Island and around New York are key to that majority.\" Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.
