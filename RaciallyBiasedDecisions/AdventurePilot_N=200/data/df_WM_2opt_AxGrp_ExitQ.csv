8514882.0,Yes,I think the scenarios should describe the surroundings better to make the experience more immersive. It was good but usually a dungeon master provides more information about what things look like.,Jamal,I felt that both Jack and Jamal made reasonable decisions in their adventure. I thought that Jamal proceeded through the underground areas more carefully with better regard for their surrounding than Jack did who seemed more willing to take risks based on the situation.,I felt that both players made reasonable decisions. I thought that Jamal was the smartest player because he was not so aggressive as Jack and more carefully checked the area for traps.,The setting of the adventure was two archaeologists named Jack and Jamal who an underground passage through a hole and went exploring the underground area while checking for traps and fighting skeletons and things like that that one would find in a dungeon explorer game.,I have no questions or concerns to share about this study.,2

8514951.0,Yes,"Choosing either reward or punish isn't the most immersive thing. I think making actual choices about what to do would be better and more engaging, such as choosing what exactly happens.",Jack ,"Yes, aside from one mistake that stood out to me.",I felt indifferent as their actions didn't stand out to me so I couldn't tell them apart.,It was indoors in an underground location that was discovered.,I don't,-1
